# Flask:

* Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.

* Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features for creating web applications in the Python Language.

* When developing a web application, it is important to separate business logic from presentation logic. 

* Business logic is what handles user requests and talks to the database to build an appropriate response. 

* Presentation logic is how the data is presented to the user, typically using HTML files to build the basic structure of the response web page, and CSS styles to style HTML components.
